# Python Face Recognition

## Description
This is a Python-based face recognition project that detects and recognizes faces in images or webcam input.  
It uses **OpenCV** and the **face_recognition** library to demonstrate practical computer vision techniques.  

## Status
⚠️ Work in Progress  
The project is currently under development and has not yet been fully tested.  

## Features (Planned)
- Detect faces from images or live webcam feed
- Recognize known faces using a trained dataset
- Draw bounding boxes around detected faces
- Save recognized face data for future use

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `opencv-python`
- `face_recognition`
- `numpy`

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-face-recognition.git
